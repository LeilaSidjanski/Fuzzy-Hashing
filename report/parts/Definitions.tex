\section{Definitions}
\begin{description}
    \item[Equal Error Rate (EER)] \label{def:EER} Metric used to evaluate the performance of a system. It represents the point at which the system's \hyperref[def:FAR]{false acceptance rate (FAR)} equals its \hyperref[def:FRR]{false rejection rate (FRR)}. A lower EER indicates a more accurate and reliable system as it signifies a balanced trade-off between security (minimizing FAR) and usability (minimizing FRR)

    \item[False Acceptance Rate (FAR)] \label{def:FAR} This is the probability of incorrectly accepting an unauthorized user

    \item[False rejection Rate (FRR)] \label{def:FRR} This is the the probability of incorrectly rejecting an authorized user

    \item[Hash Function] \label{def:Hash_Function} A hash function is an algorithm that converts input data of any size to a fixed-size string of characters, which typically acts as a data fingerprint. The output, known as a hash, is unique for different inputs in ideal cases, making hash functions crucial for cryptography, data integrity, and indexing in databases.
