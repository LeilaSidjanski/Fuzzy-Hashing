\section{Fuzzy Hashing}
\label{sec:Fuzzy Hashing}
Fuzzy hashing, as opposed to traditional hashing, produces consistent cryptographic keys for similar but not identical inputs, enabling recognition of the same biometric trait across different instances despite slight variations. This approach ensures legitimate users are not incorrectly denied access due to minor discrepancies and protects user privacy by storing and using hashed values instead of raw biometric data, making it difficult to reverse-engineer the original data even if unauthorized access occurs. 
This section will discuss how we implemented the fuzzy hashing algorithm, its corresponding mathematical aspects and some experiments.

\subsection{PreHashing Algorithm}

The \textit{PreHash} algorithm is the first step in the fuzzy hashing process, designed to manipulate biometric templates extracted from finger vein patterns. It operates on a bitstring \(X\), representing the presence (1) or absence (0) of vein pixels across \(n\) pixels, where \(n=96'500\).

Algorithm Inputs and Outputs:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Inputs}: The algorithm takes three main inputs:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{A parameter m}: the number of indices to find
        \item \textbf{A bitstring X}: the feature-extracted vein patterns of a biometric capture
        \item \textbf{A key}: used to initialize a Pseudorandom Number Generator (PRNG)
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Output}: The algorithm outputs a tuple \((i_1,...,i_m)\) consisting of the \(m\) smallest indices \(i_j\)​ such that \(1 \leq i_1<...<i_m\)​ and the pixel at \(PRNGkey(i_j)\) in \(X\) is identified as a vein pixel. 
\end{enumerate}

Detailed Process of \textit{PreHash}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Initiallization}: Utilizing the provided key, the algorithm initializes a PRNG. This PRNG is based on the \hyperref[def:AES CTR mode]{Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in Counter (CTR) mode}, ensuring the generation of uniform and independent pseudorandom sequences.

    \item \textbf{Nonce Generation}: A nonce in CTR mode encryption is initialized to zero to maintain simplicity and security. We opted against using a keyed hash function to generate the nonce, as it would tie the nonce to the secret key. Such a dependency would mean that both the nonce and the Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) would rely on the same key, creating a security risk by concentrating security on a single element. To avoid this, we keep the generation of the nonce separate from the key.

    \item \textbf{Pseudorandom Sequence Generation}: Upon receiving the parameters —key, nonce, and counter— the PRNG utilizes CTR mode to produce a \(128\)-bit pseudo-random number. However, to tailor the output to the project's requirements, it is necessary to mask it to \(17\) bits. This adjustment is essential as it aims to ensure that pseudo-random numbers are generated within a suitable range form image size, specifically \(96'500\) pixels, which requires \(17\) bits for representation\footnote{\(\lceil \log_2(96'500) \rceil = 17\)}. The predictability of this sequence is entirely dictated by the chosen key. In essence, employing the same key will consistently yield an identical nonce and hence an identical sequence of numbers.

    \item \textbf{Selection of Indices}: The algorithm iterates through the generated pseudorandom sequence, selecting the first \(m\) indices corresponding to vein pixels in the biometric template \(X\). This selection process involves a careful mechanism to ensure the uniqueness and proper ordering of indices.

    \item \textbf{Handling the Case \(m >\) (Number of 1's in Vein Image)}: In scenarios where the specified number of vein pixels \(m\) cannot be found due to the absence of sufficient vein pixels within the biometric template, the algorithm incorporates a built-in mechanism to address such situations. Before executing the prehash algorithm, it iterates through the image and verifies if the count of pixels equal to 1 is less than \(m\).

\end{itemize}

    \caption{\textit{preHash} Algorithm}
    \label{preHash Algorithm}
\end{figure}

The algorithm, preHash, illustrated in Figure~\ref{preHash Algorithm} generates \(m\) smallest indices, denoted by \(i_j\), such that \(j\in{[1, m]} \) and \(1 <= i_1 < ... < i_m\), where each \(i_j\) correponds to an index such that \(X_{PRNG_{key}(i_j)} = 1\). It achieves this by rigorously verifying that the numbers produced by PRNG (PRNG[i]) stay within the specified bounds \(\text{PRNG}[i] \in (0, n] \text{ for } i \in [0, m]\).

\subsection{Assessing Similarity of Biometric Inputs After PreHash Application}

After the finger images are processed through the pipeline described in Pipeline~\ref{pipeline_simon} to extract their feature vectors, and the \textit{preHash} algorithm is applied, the outcome is a set of indices that fall within the inclusive range \(\text{PRNG}[i] \in (0, n] \text{ for } i \in [0, m]\), effectively mapping each selected feature to a unique index within the feature vector's length.

In the context of a simplified scenario where the hash length parameter (\(m\)) is set to \(1\), implying the generation of a single-index hash, and assuming a randomly chosen key for the \textit{preHash} algorithm, along with \(k\) representing a uniformly distributed random index, the probability that the \textit{preHash} operation yields the same index for two different inputs \(X\) and \(Y\) can be mathematically delineated as follows:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:preHash1}
    \begin{aligned}
        Pr[preHash_{key}^1(X) = preHash_{key}^1(Y)] &= \sum_{i > 0} Pr[preHash_{key}^1(X)]\\
        &= preHash_{key}^1(Y)\\
        &= \sum_{i > 0} Pr[X_k = Y_k = 0]^{i - 1} Pr[X_k = Y_k = 1]\\
        &= \frac{Pr[X_k = Y_k = 1]}{1 - Pr[X_k = Y_k = 0]}\\
        &= \frac{HW(X \land Y)}{HW(X) + HW(Y) - HW(X \land Y)}\\
        &= \frac{1}{\frac{1}{Score(X, Y)} - 1}
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

This equation encapsulates the likelihood of two images, \(X\) and \(Y\), having their singular hash index coincide, based on the presence of matching features identified by the algorithm. The final form of the equation relates the probability to the scoring function between \(X\) and \(Y\), inversely proportional to the score minus one.

It is noticed that there is a direct link with the Miura matching score that is of interest. The direct link between the \textit{preHash} algorithm's outcomes and the Miura matching score lies in their shared foundation of evaluating biometric similarities. Specifically, both methodologies utilize Hamming weight and bitwise operations to assess the overlap between biometric samples, such as finger vein patterns. The \textit{preHash} algorithm, through its probabilistic formula, quantifies the likelihood of matching indices based on feature presence, closely paralleling the Miura score's approach of comparing binary patterns to derive a similarity score. The above computation can also be expressed as follows:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:preHash2}
    \begin{aligned}
        Pr[preHash_{key}^1(\bar{X}) = preHash_{key}^1(\bar{Y})] &= \frac{Pr[\bar{X}_k = \bar{Y}_k = 1]}{1 - Pr[\bar{X}_k = \bar{Y}_k = 0]}\\
        &= \frac{\frac{Pr[X_k = 1] + Pr[Y_k = 1]}{2} - \frac{1}{2}Pr[\bar{X}_l \neq \bar{Y}_k]}{\frac{Pr[X_k = 1] + Pr[Y_k = 1]}{2} + \frac{1}{2}Pr[\bar{X}_l \neq \bar{Y}_k]}\\
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

The following approximations are made, inspired by equations p (\ref{eq:proba}) and $\delta$ (\ref{eq:delta}):

\begin{equation}
    E\left(\frac{\frac{Pr[X_k = 1] + Pr[Y_k = 1]}{2} - \frac{1}{2}Pr[\bar{X}_l \neq \bar{Y}_k]}{\frac{Pr[X_k = 1] + Pr[Y_k = 1]}{2} + \frac{1}{2}Pr[\bar{X}_l \neq \bar{Y}_k]}\right) \approx \frac{p - \frac{\delta}{2}}{p + \frac{\delta}{2}}
\end{equation}

The core of this approximation revolves around the expectation formula, which integrates probabilities of feature presence \(Pr[X_k=1]+Pr[Y_k=1]\) and the likelihood of discrepancies between \(X\) and \(Y\), \(Pr[\bar{X}_l \neq \bar{Y}_k]\). This formula essentially aims to quantify the similarity between two biometric samples by considering both the concurrence of features and the instances where they diverge.

Hence for (\(X\), \(Y\)) random,

\begin{equation}
    Pr[preHash_{key}^1(offset_X * X) = preHash_{key}^1(offset_Y * Y)] \leq \frac{p - \frac{\delta}{2}}{p + \frac{\delta}{2}}
\end{equation}

where equality is reached for the optimal offset translations. 

Depending on the distribution of (\(X\), \(Y\)), it is denoted

\begin{equation} \label{eq:mu}
    \mu = \frac{p - \frac{\delta}{2}}{p + \frac{\delta}{2}}
\end{equation}

The following figures are provided:

\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.25}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
        \hline
        $\mu_{same}$ & $\mu_{diff}$ & $\mu_{indep}$\\
        \hline
        $24\%$ & $8.3\%$ & $1.8\%$\\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
\caption{Comparison of Distributions: $\delta_{same}$, $\delta_{diff}$, and $\delta_{indep}$}
\end{table}

Finally, it is observed that

\begin{equation}
    Pr[preHash_{key}^m(offset_X * X) = preHash_{key}^m(offset_Y * Y)] \leq \mu^m
\end{equation}

where equality is reached for the optimal offset translations.

%This includes determining the upper limits for the probabilities of similarity between different finger veins processed through the same fuzzy hashing parameters.
