\section{Experimental Verifications}

\subsection{Methodology for Assessing Theoretical Values (p, delta, mu)}
% p = probability of a vein pixel being present in a given biometric sample
% delta = probability of differences between two biometric samples 
% mu = theoretical matching probability under optimal conditions (mu depends on p and delta)

\subsection{Analyzing FPR and FNR (Disussion of Results)}
